Docker is available in three tiers:

* Docker Engine - Community
* Docker Engine - Enterprise
* Docker Enterprise

Docker Engine - Community is ideal for individual developers and small teams looking to get started with Docker and experimenting with container-based apps.

Docker Engine - Enterprise is designed for enterprise development of a container runtime with security and an enterprise grade SLA in mind.

Docker Enterprise is designed for enterprise development and IT teams who build, ship, and run business critical applications in production at scale.
